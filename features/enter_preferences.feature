Feature: participants can enter preferences

As a participant,
So that I can select which times I like and get the times I want,
I want to be able to rank the times.

Background: A project is set up and participants are invited to rank times
    Given a registered user with the email "raichu@berkeley.edu" with username "raichu" exists
    And a registered user with the username "raichu" has a project named "CS169 Sections"
    And the project named "CS169 Sections" has the following participants:
    | email                  |
    | empoleon@berkeley.edu  |
    | charizard@berkeley.edu |

    And the project named "CS169 Sections" has the following times:
    | datetime               |
    | Dec 1 2019 10:00 AM    |
    | Dec 1 2019 1:00 PM     |

    And a participant to project "CS169 Sections" with email "empoleon@berkeley.edu" has a secretid "empoleonsecretid"
    And a participant to project "CS169 Sections" with email "charizard@berkeley.edu" has a secretid "charizardsecretid"



  Scenario: User enters their preferences for times
    When I access the time ranking page for project "CS169 Sections" from email "empoleon@berkeley.edu" and secretid "empoleonsecretid"
    Then I should see "Please enter your preferences for these times."
    And I should not see "Access denied"
    When I choose "Cannot go" for time "Dec 1 2019 10:00 AM"
    And I choose "Preferred" for time "Dec 1 2019 1:00 PM"
    And I press "Submit"
    Then I should see "Thanks for submitting your preferences!"


  Scenario: User attempts to enter preferences for times for a project that they are not a part of
    I access the time ranking page for project of id "1" from user id "6" and secretid "none"
    Then I should see "Access denied."

  Scenario: User attempts to enter preferences with the wrong secret id
    When I access the time ranking page for project "CS169 Sections" from email "empoleon@berkeley.edu" and secretid "empoleonfakesecretid"
    Then I should see "Access denied."

  Scenario: User attempts to enter preferences for times for a project that does not exist
    I access the time ranking page for project of id "99" from user id "6" and secretid "none"
    Then I should see "Project does not exist."

  Scenario: User submits without filling out all of the preferences
    When I access the time ranking page for project "CS169 Sections" from email "empoleon@berkeley.edu" and secretid "empoleonsecretid"
    Then I should see "Please enter your preferences for these times."
    When I choose "Cannot go" for time "Dec 1 2019 10:00 AM"
    And I press "Submit"
    Then I should see "Error: please fill in an option for each time."
